# to-do-list
A simple beginner to-do app is a basic web application that allows users to manage their tasks. Typically, it includes the following core features:

Task Creation: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
Marking Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as completed, often with a visual indicator such as a strikethrough or a checkbox.
Basic UI: The interface usually consists of an input field to enter tasks, a button to add tasks, and a list where tasks are displayed.
This type of app is often built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a great project for beginners to practice fundamental web development skills. It introduces key concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic data storage using arrays or local storage.
